### Need a blog?
I just want to create a blog today to jurnal something done. 
But…how the heck do you get started? There’s so much info out there on the web, and everyone’s telling you to do different things. Who do you listen to? Where’s the starting point?

### Want to start a blog huh? Great idea!
I found some ideas from here  aimetpgm.github.io/blog/jekyll/2019/05/08/jekyll-github-page.html

here martinpeck.com/jekyll/blog/containers/2019/02/02/build-and-deploy-jekyll-with-docker-part1/

and here medium.com/@sebagomez/setting-up-a-github-page-with-jekyll-and-a-docker-container-c712e448649b
