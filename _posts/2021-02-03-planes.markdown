### Anyone completed this?
Of course, I follow the "Migrate from Apache Cassandra to Amazon Keyspaces" here aws.amazon.com/getting-started/hands-on/move-to-managed/migrate-cassandra-to-amazon-keyspaces/. 

### Springboard jump
Instead of EC2 instance I was created a Cassandra node from here digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-cassandra-and-run-a-single-node-cluster-on-ubuntu-14-04 and generated csv file from it.

But at the end “I found it easier” with AWS CLI docker aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/aws-cli-v2-docker-image/. 

So I end up with github.com/aws-samples/amazon-keyspaces-toolkit and use cqlsh from inside the container connect to Amazon Keyspaces with IAM account created to copy csv file into Amazon Keyspaces table.
